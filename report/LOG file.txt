Inference:
    -> Here both CPP model and TF's model were able to classify the input image as "Dog" class (class: 5).
    -> Hence this proves that the mathematics that had happened inside the layers in both CPP and the trained model are similar.

Model Layer-Wise Outputs:
    -> The layer-wise outputs of both the TensorFlow model and the CPP model have been pushed for comparison.
    -> The final output layer of both models aligns perfectly, further validating that the underlying computations and architecture are identical.
